        <h1>The case for land value taxes</h1>
        <h2>Where do land values come from?</h2>
        The first rule of real estate investing is "location, location, location", because the value of a property is primarily determined by the value of the location it sits on.
        <br>
        In general, the total value of a plot of land and all its improvements is the size of the land, multiplied by the location value, plus value of improvements such as buildings or the quality of the soil.
        <br>
        When someone owns a plot of land, they can increase its value by improving the land with buildings or soil improvements for farming.
        <br>
        The size of the plot of land is fixed, but where does the location value come from?
        <br>
        The location value comes from the value of improvements on nearby land. The landowner gains a share in the improvements that nearby landowners make to their lands, even though they did not pay for those improvements.
        <br>
        This is great if you're the landowner, you get to watch the value of your land increase, while you don't have to do any work. Improvements to your land value are socialized, while you get to privatize ownership of a share of that value.
        <br>
        When everyone can afford enough land to live on, this system works well for everyone involved. Everyone gets to own a share in the value of the community.
        <br>
        <h3>The beginning of the problem</h3>
        What happens when the land starts to run out? People no longer are able to gain a share in the communal land value, yet they need a place to live. Thus rent is born.
        <br>
        Rent comes from a sum of two sources.
        <br>
        The first is the value of the property which the landowner has built and maintains. This value was created through the private investment of the landowner, and so he has a right to a return on that investment.
        <br>
        The second source is the location value multiplied by the acerage, which is known as the <b>land value</b>. Since the land value comes from the community, yet the landowner can charge a rent for it, the landowner has privatized profit from a socialized source which he did not create.
        <h3>The extent of the problem</h3>
        Everyone needs a place to live, and will generally pay whatever it costs, since the alternative is homelessness.
        <br>
        Now that all the land in a given area has been bought up and the landowners can privatize the social value, the rent will keep increasing to match the minimum that people are capable of paying.
        <br>
        When the economy of an area is doing well, workers start to make more money, and so rent rises to match what workers can afford.
        <br>
        The only way to get ahead in this system is to make more money than the average worker, and hope that your landlord doesn't increase your rent fast enough until you can afford your own property.
        <br>
        The landowners get to soak up the wealth created by the hard work of the workers, largely through no effort of their own. The landowners have an honest claim to rent dervied from building and maintaining the property, but the rent which is dervied from the land value is a dishonest claim.
        <br>
        This broken system is only further compounded by the fact that when your average worker sells their land, it is sold to someone with equal or greater wealth, due to the huge pressure for rising land values.
        <br>
        So land naturally tends towards being owned by a smaller and smaller group of individuals, who collectively own the social wealth produced by the workers, which they have no honest claim to.
        <br>
        Even worse than this compounding trend is the fact that the average worker becomes dependent on that dishonest claim to social wealth. This isn't an attack on the worker, after all, they are just trying to make an honest living for themselves and their family.
        <br>
        However, this does trap the worker into depending on a system which increasingly takes away his share of social wealth and concentrates it to a smaller and smaller group of people.
        <br>
        Societies built on this kind of system are addicted to privatizing land values, and so are blinded to the solution, in the same way that any drug addict is blind to or actively ignores solutions to their addiction.
        <br>
        Through this blindness, a huge range of solutions which only manage the problem are politicially viable, but solving the underlying disease is never taken seriously.
        <h3>Solutions which manage the problem</h3>
        Left leaning solutions propose to solve this problem through high taxes, creating strong worker regulations, and using that wealth to create a robust social safety net.
        <br>
        These solutions try to use the government to force the ideal vision of society, rather than by changing the underlying incentives which are killing society.
        <br>
        These solutions are doomed to fail, because no matter how high taxes are, or how strong worker regulations are, or how strong the social safety nets are, land rents will continue to be privatized.
        <br>
        Both the workers and the businesses will slowly have more and more of their wealth they create captured by landowners, until the left leaning policies result in businesses no longer being profitable.
        <br>
        Once the businesses are unprofitable, workers will lose their incomes, sell their property to live, which will only make the problem worse in the long run.
        <br>
        Solutions further to the left will try to have the government centrally manage everything, including ownership of land. However, without a free market, subjective value cannot be determined, and so businesses will collapse.
        <br>
        Right leaning solutions propose to free up businesses by removing regulations, thereby increasing the amount of wealth which can be put to good use by businesses and workers.
        <br>
        However, that wealth will too be captured by land values, and society will eventually become dependent on having minimal worker protections and minimal wages.
        <br>
        Solutions further to the right will propose things like restricting who can work. These solutions are doomed to fail because even if the supply of workers decreases and the wage of the average worker increases, rents will rise to match those wages.
        <br>
        This is how far right societies can get absurd ideas like removing women from the workforce. Once women were able to work, incomes increased, but so did rents. Now, both men and women have to work to afford a place to live.
        <br>
        Far right views can see this problem, but they attribute the problem to women, and not private ownership of land values.
        <br>
        Once the land is owned by a small group of people and the economy is ruined, the only place left to extract more value is other countries, and so begins war.
        <h3>The solution to the problem</h3>
        The rental value of land, as opposed to the rental value of property, should be owned by who creates that value - the people of the community.
        <br>
        By taxing the rental value of land at 100%, landowners are no longer incentivized to buy land purely for rent seeking and land speculation.
        <br>
        In order to make money from land, the landowner will have to do something productive with that land.
        <br>
        In a general sense, whatever is taxed, society has less of. Whatever is subsidized, society has more of. Taxing the <b>unimproved</b> value of land results in less unimproved land.
        <br>
        Extreme ownership of land values is how there can be cities of great wealth, but huge amounts of homelessness and vacant buildings.
        <br>
        Instead of that land being put to good use, the landowners are waiting to sell the land to someone at a higher price, or charge an exorbitant rent.
        <br>
        So any city which has private ownership of land values will end up with extreme poverty and underutilized land, until it becomes unlivable and people move away.
        <br>
        The land rents can be distributed back to the community in the form of a dividend. Every month, every resident gets a check of their share of the communal land value.
        <br>
        This solves the worst of the entitlement crisis, and also solves the worst of the issues around workers rights.
        <br>
        The dividend can pay for basic needs, and businesses will have to provide incentives that people are willing to work for.
        <br>
        In addition to solving these issues, land value taxes will also reduce the cost of the present entitlements, which are strangling governments with huge debts.
        <br>
        They will fix these costs by removing the incentives for rent seeking and land speculation which are a disaster for the economy.
        <br>
        Similar to energy costs, when housing goes up, everything costs more, because all citizens need to afford a place to live, and so workers have to somehow make a livable wage.
        <br>
        With rent seeking and land speculation removed, people are now free to build far more housing than before, due to the strangling of the land being removed.
        <br>
        This will drive down rent prices, reducing the cost of everything, while improving the purchasing power of the workers.
        <h1>Objections to land value taxes</h1>
        <h3>How can land values be separated from property values?</h3>
        Modern surveying methods do a good job of this (insert link here).
        <br>
        Even though your local tax assessment might say that your land value is low and your property value is high, your property has been increasing in value due to rising land values, not rising property values.
        <br>
        Once land value taxes are in place, local governments will be incentivized to correct these assessments.
        <br>
        There is a kind of market effect in determining how much to tax land values. If land values taxes are too low, land is underutilized due to rent seeking by private individuals. If land value taxes are too high, land is underutilized due to an equivalent form of rent seeking by the local government.
        <br>
        When land value taxes are tuned correctly, revenue from the tax, and therefore the monthly dividend, is maximized. Counties can compete with each other to find what the best ways of assessing land values are.
        <h3>Won't this cause huge economic inefficiencies and stop people from building housing?</h3>
        No. It will do the exact opposite. Land value taxes are the only tax which have no <b>deadweight loss</b>. In fact, land value taxes incentivize growth by removing the equivalent deadweight loss brought on by rent seeking and land speculation.
        <br>
        The reason it has no deadweight loss is because land isn't created, and so taxing is doesn't change how much of it exists.
        <h3>Won't honest landlords be put out of business?</h3>
        Generally not, landlords can still make money off of providing an honest service. Slumlords will be put out of business, because they can no longer live off of the land values.
        <h3>Won't grandma lose her home?</h3>
        Generally not, in many cases, the dividend will be enough to cover the land value taxes. At the very least, it will be enough to afford a place to live in a less in-demand area, so grandma won't go homeless.
        <br>
        There's already a huge homelessness problem, land value taxes will take away the danger of homelessness to anyone who is capable of taking care of themselves.
        <br>
        If someone does have a plot of land in a highly valuable area, then it will have to be put to good use or sold to someone who can put it to good use. That's the price which is paid for land value taxes, which is an enormously smaller price than what we currently pay.
        <br>
        There are no solutions in economics, only tradeoffs.
        <h3>Won't farmers lose their farms?</h3>
        Even though a farmer's land might have a huge market value, the rental value of that land will be quite low. If a farmer can only make $50k/year on the land, then they might only be willing to pay a few thousand a year if they were to lease the land from someone else.
        <h3>Won't companies no longer search for new underground resources or do any R&D?</h3>
        No, companies will still make money off of their efforts to find resources. They will make money off of the production and sale of those resources.
        <br>
        To incentivize this further, an increasing land value tax can be placed on new resources or patents that increases overtime.
        <br>
        This ensures that companies can still make a profit strictly off of exploration and research, but also will eventually cause the value of that land to be communally owned.
        <h3>You will own nothing, you will be happy.</h3>
        People will still own their capital investments, and can make passive income off of that. There's no issue with that passive income, because it was derived from their own wealth, rather than the wealth of the community.
        <br>
        It's the addiction to using housing as an investment/retirement vehicle which got us into this mess. For the sake of ourselves and our descendents, we should break ourselves out of this addiction.
        <h3>If this is so great, why haven't other countries done this?</h3>
        Land value taxes have been used to great effect in many areas.
