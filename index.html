        <summary>Where do real estate prices come from?</summary>
        <section id="where">
            <p>Real estate prices are derived from the sum of the property value and the land value.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Property values are what someone is willing to pay for the improvements (buildings, water pipes, tilled soil, etc) of the asset.</li>
          <li>Land values are what someone would be willing to pay for the asset if it had no improvements.
            <br>
            This is can be thought of as the value of the location multiplied by the size of the plot.
            <br>
            This is also known as the <b>unimproved value</b> of the land.
          </li>
          </ul>
          <img src="land-vs-property.png" width="1000" height="500">
          <p>Since the property value generally depreciates over time due to material wear, and the size of the plot stays the same, then rising real estate prices must be caused by rising location values.</p>
          <h3>Where does the location value come from?</h3>
          <p>The location value comes from the value of improvements on nearby land.
            <br>
            The landowner gains a share in the value of improvements that nearby landowners make to their lands, even though they did not pay for those improvements.
          <p>This is great if you're the landowner, you get to watch the value of your land increase, while you don't have to do any work.
            <br>
            Improvements to your land value are socialized, while you get to privatize ownership of a share of that value.</p>
          </p>
          <p>When everyone can afford enough land to live on, this system works well for everyone involved. Everyone gets to own a share in the value of the community.</p>

        <summary>The beginning of the problem</summary>
        <section id="begin">
        <p>What happens when the land starts to run out?
          <br>
          People no longer are able to afford a plot of land, yet they need a place to live. Thus rent is born.</p>
        <p>The rent price comes from a sum of two sources.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The value of the property that the landowner has bought or built and maintains.
            <br>
            This value was created through the private investment of the landowner, therefore he has a rightful claim to a share of the value of it.</li>
            <li>The land value
              <br>
              This value comes from the community, yet the landowner charges a rent for it, and so has privatized profit from a socialized source which he has no rightful claim to.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <summary>The extent of the problem</summary>
        <section id="extent">
        <p>If all the land in an area has been bought and the workers start to make more money, rent rises to match what workers can afford.
          <br>
          Everyone needs a place to live, and will generally pay whatever it costs, since the alternative is homelessness.
        </p>
        <img src="wealth-transfer.jpg" width="400" height="500">
        <p>The only way to get ahead in this system is to make more money than the average worker, and hope that your landlord doesn't increase your rent fast enough until you can afford your own property.</p>
        <p>The landowners soak up the wealth created by the hard work of the workers, largely through no effort of their own.
          <br>
          The landowners have an rightful claim to rent derived from building and maintaining the property, but no rightful claim to the rent derived from the location value.
        </p>
        <img src="everybody-works-but-the-lot.jpg" width="800" height="500">
        <p>This broken system is only further compounded by the fact that when your average worker sells their land, it is usually sold for a higher price.
        <br>
        Land naturally tends towards being owned by a small group of individuals, who collectively own the wealth produced by the workers, which they have no honest claim to.
        </p>
        <figure>

        <figcaption>The wealthiest 10% own around 40% of all real estate in the USA.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Even worse than this compounding trend is the fact that the average worker becomes dependent on that unearned claim to social wealth.
          <br>
        This traps the worker into depending on a system which increasingly takes away his share of wealth and concentrates it to a small group of people.
        </p>
        <p>Societies built on this kind of system are addicted to privatizing land values, and so are blinded to the solution, in the same way that any drug addict ignores solutions to their addiction.
          <br>
          Through this blindness, only solutions which manage the problem are politicially viable, while curing the underlying disease is never taken seriously.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Take now ... some hard-headed business man, who has no theories, but knows how to make money.
            <br>
            Say to him: "Here is a little village; in ten years it will be a great cityâ€”in ten years the railroad will have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light of the candle;
            <br>
            it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously multiply the effective power of labor.
            <br>
            Will in ten years, interest be any higher?"</p>
          <p>He will tell you, "No!"</p>
          <p>"Will the wages of common labor be any higher; will it be easier for a man who has nothing but his labor to make an independent living?"</p>
          <p>He will tell you, "No; the wages of common labor will not be any higher;
            <br>
            on the contrary, all the chances are that they will be lower;
            <br>
            it will not be easier for the mere laborer to make an independent living; the chances are that it will be harder."</p>
          <p>"What, then, will be higher?"</p>
          <p>"Rent, the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold possession."</p>
          <p>And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe;
            <br>
            you may lie around like the lazzaroni of Naples or the leperos of Mexico;
            <br>
            you may go up in a balloon or down a hole in the ground;
            <br>
            and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota of wealth to the community, in ten years you will be rich!
            <br>
            In the new city you may have a luxurious mansion, but among its public buildings will be an almshouse.</p>

          <summary id="small-summary">Left leaning solutions</summary>
          <p>Left leaning solutions propose to solve this problem through high taxes, creating strong worker regulations, and using that wealth to create a robust social safety net.</p>
          <p>These solutions try to use the government to force the ideal vision of society, rather than by changing the underlying incentives which are killing society.
            <br>
          They are doomed to fail, because no matter how high taxes are, or how strong worker regulations are, or how strong the social safety nets are, land rents will continue to be privatized.
          </p>
          <p>Both the workers and the businesses will slowly have more and more of their wealth captured by landowners and the government, until businesses are no longer profitable.
            <br>
            Once they are unprofitable, workers will lose their incomes and sell their property to live, which will only make the problem worse in the long run.</p>
          <p>Solutions further to the left will try to have the government centrally manage everything, including ownership of land.
            <br>
            However, this steals the fruits of labor from the individual, which destroys the incentive to create wealth.
          </p>
          <p>Occasionally, wealth taxes will be proposed as a solution.
            <br>
            This may involve taxing land, but tends not to tax land to the necessary degree, and instead institutes taxes which cause large <b>deadweight loss</b>.</p>

          <summary id="small-summary">Right leaning solutions</summary>
          <p>Right leaning solutions propose to free up businesses by removing regulations, thereby increasing the amount of wealth which can be put to efficient use by businesses and workers.
            <br>
          However, that wealth will too be captured by land values, and society will eventually become dependent on having minimal worker protections and business regulations.</p>
          <p>Solutions further to the right will propose things like restricting who can work.
            <br>
            These solutions are doomed to fail because even if the supply of workers decreases and the wage of the average worker increases, rents will rise to match those wages.</p>
          <p>This is how far right societies can get absurd ideas like removing women from the workforce.
            <br>
            Once women were able to work, incomes increased, but so did rents.
            <br>
            Now, both men and women have to work to afford a place to live.</p>
          <p>Far right views can see a problem, but misattribute the problem to certain groups of people, and not private ownership of land values.</p>

          <summary id="small-summary">Centrist solutions</summary>
          <p>Centrist solutions generally try to use government spending to stimulate the economy, particularly by building out infrastructure.
            <br>
            These solutions may help in the short term.
            <br>
            However, the wealth created will increase land values, which will get captured by the landowners.</p>
          <p>The government may even sell bonds to fund these projects.
            <br>
            These bonds may even be sold to the landowners!
            <br>
            Now, the landowners get paid twice. Both from interest on the bond (which is paid by the taxpayers), and on the rising land values.
            <br>
            If the government can't afford to pay back the bondholders through taxes, then it may sell off assets, including land, likely to the very same wealthy landowners!
            <br>
            How fortunate for the landowners!</p>
            <br>
        </details>
        <p>Once the land is owned by a small group of people and the economy is ruined, the only place left to extract more wealth so that the landowners can survive, is other countries.
          <br>
          Thus begins war.

        <summary>The solution to the problem</summary>
        <section id="solution">
        <p>The rental value of land, as opposed to the rental value of property, should be owned by who creates that value - the people of the community.
          <br>
        By taxing the rental value of land at 100%, landowners are no longer incentivized to buy land purely for rent seeking and land speculation.
          <br>
        In order to make money from land, the landowner will have to do something productive with that land.
        </p>
        <p>The land rents can additionally be distributed back to the community in the form of a dividend. Every month, every resident gets a check for their share of the tax revenue.
          <br>
          The dividend can pay for basic needs, and businesses will have to provide incentives that people are willing to work for.
          <br>
          This solves the worst of the entitlement crisis, and also solves the worst of the issues around workers rights.
        </p>
        <p>Similar to energy costs, when housing goes up, everything costs more, because all citizens need to afford a place to live, and so workers have to somehow make a livable wage.
          <br>
        By removing the economic inefficiencies of rent seeking and land speculation, housing development and businesses will be far more free to grow.
          <br>
        This will drive down rent prices, reducing the cost of everything, while improving the purchasing power of the workers.
        </p>
        <p>Extreme ownership of land values is how there can be cities of great wealth, but huge amounts of homelessness and vacant buildings.
          <br>
        Instead of that land being put to good use, the landowners are waiting to sell the land to someone at a higher price, or charge an exorbitant rent.
          <br>
        So any city which has private ownership of land values will end up with extreme poverty and underutilized land, until it becomes unlivable and people move away.
        </p>
        <p>In a general sense, whatever is taxed, society has less of. Whatever is subsidized, society has more of. Taxing the <b>unimproved value of land</b> results in less unimproved land.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>In my opinion, the least bad tax is the tax on the unimproved value of land.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>- Milton Friedman</p>
        <p>In the same way that we Americans love the 2nd amendment, because it puts a limit on how much power the government can have, land value taxes put a limit on how much power landowners can have.</p>

        <p><a style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/server/api/core/bitstreams/b0fe4963-c5d3-41dd-a2c8-a6453bd6f131/content">Modern surveying methods</a> do a good job of this:
          <blockquote>We have found in our application of these methods to data from

            expert based land values. Unlike those expert based estimates,
            the statistical methods we used are transparent and can be standardised.
          </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>Even though your local tax assessment might say that your land value is low and your property value is high, your property has been increasing in value due to rising land values, not rising property values.
          <br>
          Once land value taxes are in place, local governments will be incentivized to correct these assessments.</p>
          <p>There is a kind of market effect in determining how much to tax land values.
            <br>
            If land values taxes are too low, land is underutilized due to rent seeking by private individuals.
            <br>
            If land value taxes are too high, land is underutilized due to an equivalent form of rent seeking by the local government.
            <br>
            When land value taxes are tuned correctly, revenue from the tax, and therefore the monthly dividend, is maximized.
            <br>
            Counties can compete with each other to find what the best ways of assessing land values are.</p>

        <summary id="small-summary">Won't this tax just be passed onto renters?</summary>
        <p>Not as increased rent.
          <br>
          Landlords are already charging the maximum they can due to everyone needing a place to live.
          <br>
          Both renters and real estate buyers are already paying the equivalent land value tax, but it goes straight into the pocket of the landlord rather than back to society.
        </p>
          <p>
          Land value taxes won't directly cause rent to decrease, they just redirect the land rent to society.
          <br>
          They will indirectly cause rent to decrease by removing the toughest barriers to building more housing supply.

        <p>No. It will do the exact opposite. Land value taxes have no <b>deadweight loss</b>.
          <br>
          In fact, land value taxes incentivize growth by removing the equivalent deadweight loss brought on by rent seeking and land speculation.
          <br>
          The reason it has no deadweight loss is because land has a fixed supply, therefore taxing it doesn't change how much of it exists.

        <summary id="small-summary">Land value taxes don't fix wealth inequality - most wealth today is held in stocks and other immaterial sources.</summary>
        <p>Land values taxes aren't meant to fix wealth inequality in general.
          <br>
          The only reason wealth inequality is a major issue is because people cannot afford food, housing, and healthcare.
          <br>
          Taxes to fix wealth inequality don't solve the underlying problem of unaffordable necessary goods and services.
          <br>
          In fact, they can make the problem worse due to inflation - more money purchasing the same (or less) goods and services.
        </p>
          <p>
          Land and capital should be treated as two separate things, otherwise the issues caused by land inequality and wealth inequality are conflated.
          <br>
          Wealth in terms of capital does not prevent people from accessing food, housing, and healthcare.
          <br>
          Owning shares in a healthcare company does not prevent people from accessing healthcare. In fact, it increases access to healthcare by increasing investment in healthcare.
          <br>
          By taxing land values, inequality stops being a major issue, because people will be able to afford the basic necessities.
          </p>
          In case more tax revenue is required, the government can levy income taxes on the largest corporations - but this is outside the scope of land value taxes.

        <p>Generally not, in many cases, the dividend will be enough to cover the land value taxes. At the very least, it will be enough to afford a place to live in a less in-demand area, so grandma won't go homeless.</p>
        <p>There's already a huge homelessness problem. Land value taxes will take away the danger of homelessness from anyone who is capable of taking care of themselves.
          <br>
          If someone does have a plot of land in a highly valuable area, then it will have to be put to good use or sold to someone who can put it to good use. That's the price which is paid for land value taxes, which is an enormously smaller price than what we currently pay.
          <br>
          The land rent must be owned by someone - wouldn't it be better to be owned by the people rather than a small group of individuals?</p>

        <p>No. Companies will still make money off of the production and sale of goods, which depend on R&D and exploration</p>
        <p>To incentivize this further, the land value tax on new discoveries can be increased over a set number of years.
          <br>
          This ensures that companies can still make a profit strictly from exploration and research without compromising the land value tax system.

          The ills of communism begin when the government taxes away the honestly earned wages of the workers.
          <br>
          Land value taxes selectively tax away the unearned land rent, leaving the workers with the fruits of their labor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Effectively, landlords are the true communists of today, living off wealth taken from the backs of the workers.
          <br>
          What they live off is communism where wealth is given to a select few - in the extreme called <b>national socialism</b> or <b>dictatorship</b>. (inb4 everyone I don't like is a nazi)
          <br>
          A dividend backed by a land value tax gives that wealth back to the workers, who worked hard for it.
        </p>
        </details>
        <details>
        <summary id="small-summary">Dividends cause a feedback loop of rent increases</summary>
        <p>This objection comes from a slight misunderstanding in thinking about the divinded.
          <br>
          Let's start with a simple hypothetical example:
          <br>
          Assume there's no government spending and distributing the tax is 100% efficient.
          <br>
          Assume that the property owners are willing to manage their properties for free.
          <ul>
            <li>A worker works a job and is willing to spend $1000/month on rent.</li>
            <li>The LVT for all housing is $1000/month.</li>
            <li>All landlords only charge $1000/month in rent to cover the LVT.</li>
            <li>The worker's $1000/month will cover rent.</li>
            <li>$1000/month per worker will go to the LVT.</li>
            <li>All workers will get $1000/month in the dividend.</li>
            <li>The worker still only has $1000/month to pay in rent:
              <br>
              $1000 from working - $1000 rent + $1000 dividend = $1000
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          The confusion comes from assuming that the dividend comes first, and the work second.
          <br>
          If the dividend is assumed to come first, then the value has been created 'by fiat' and is not backed by anything.
          <br>
          Therefore, the rent increases infinitely due to rents rising with the ability to pay.
          <br>
          If the dividend is backed by work, then rent is what worker is willing to pay out of their wages.
        </p>
        <p>
          This does have an interesting property for the case that someone doesn't work:
          <br>
          They are able to afford a basic standard of living that society can support.
          <br>
          This may seem unfair to the workers, but now the people own their labor, rather than a small group of landowners.
          <br>
          If people choose to work to provide for more than the basic requisites of life, then they're free to do so.
          <br>
          They can stay in the same place they're renting, or possibly move somewhere cheaper, to really get ahead.
