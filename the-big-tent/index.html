        <h1>Georgism is the big tent</h1>
        <p>
            Everyone wants the same things: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and ownership of the fruits of their labor. Yet, we all argue and fight over the details on how to acheive that.
            <br>
            This is because of not seeing the common issue underlying the strife in capitalist and communist societies, or anywhere in between.
            <br>
            The private ownership of <b>land rents</b> is the common cause of strife.
        </p>
        <h2>The law of rent</h2>
        <p>
        As productivity rises, landowners can charge higher rent for their land, because now it can be used to create more wealth.
        <br>
        Thus, any productivity gains are captured by landowners, resulting in the workers only keeping a meager portion of the fruits of the labor.
        <br>
        The landowner did not do anything to create this wealth, they simply extorted it from the workers through owning the rental value of the land.
        <br>
        The wealth was created by the community, but the landowner privatizes wealth he did not create.
          <blockquote>The rent of land, therefore, considered as the price paid for the use of the land, is naturally a monopoly price.
            <br>
            It is not at all proportioned to what the landlord may have laid out upon the improvement of the land, or to what he can afford to take;
            <br>
            but to what the farmer can afford to give.
          </blockquote>
          - Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations
        <br>
        <br>
        Under capitialist societies, land is slowly monopolized into the hands of a smaller and smaller group of individuals - resulting in feudalism.
        <br>
        Under communist societies, the party members monopolize the land - resulting in a dictatorship.
        <br>
        In neither case do the people truly own the fruits of their labor.
        <br>
        If everyone had an equal share in the land rents - wealth created by the community - then everyone would own the fruits of their labor.
        </p>
        <h2>Government spending</h2>
        <p>
        Whenever the government spends the wealth of the taxpayers, it culminates in a wealth transfer from the taxpayer to the land owners.
        <br>
        If the government increases welfare, land rents will rise to meet the government spending.
        <br>
        Now the land values will increase like a ratchet, since land owners will not want to sell for less than they paid.
        <br>
        The government cannot decrease the welfare, because now rents have risen to meet it, so the recipients would be worse off than before the welfare was increased.
        <br>
        The law of rent ensures that the government becomes addicted to welfare spending.
        <br>
        The same principle applies to infrastructure spending. The government will spend taxpayer money to improve the land of the landowners, allowing them to charge a higher rent.
        <br>
        This also has a side effect of making it more expensive for the government to spend in the future:
        <ul>
        <li>The workers building the infrastructure will demand a higher pay, since the rent they pay has increased.
        <li>The land owners will demand a higher sale price for their land, since the land values have increased.
        </ul>
        If the landowners are also the bondholders, then the interest that the taxpayer pays on the infrastructure spending also goes to the landowners.
        <br>
        Thus, no amount of government spending or regulation can meaningfully solve poverty in the long term. It is merely a wealth transfer from taxpayers to landowners.
        <br>
        This same principle can be extended to economic recessions:
        <br>
        Businesses are willing to spend, and workers are willing to work, yet the price of land is unaffordable.
        </p>
        <h2>Land value tax</h2>
        In Progess and Poverty, Henry George laid out these principles and stated the solution: a land value tax which funds universal basic income.
        <br>
        A land value tax can be described as a property tax with a universal improvement exemption.
        <br>
        Thus, only the land value is taxed, and not any improvement to the land such as housing.
        <br>
        The ideal tax rate is one in which a free market has people bidding how much they're willing to pay in tax.
        <br>
        Thus, land will be owned by whoever will pay the highest tax on it, then that tax will be distributed back to the people.
        <br>
        In practice, local government tax assessment is a good enough solution for pricing land values.
        <br>
        Even if land has a high sale price, what ultimately matters is how much people are willing to pay to own it.
        <br>
        For example, farmers will only pay a minimal tax, since they can only make a modest amount on the land.
        <br>
        In fact, it's likely that rural landowners will receive more from the dividend than they pay in tax.
        <br>
        This can create generate enormous revenue, while also freeing up unused or underdeveloped land for high density development.
        <br>
        By increasing the housing supply and giving every citizen an equal share of the tax revenue, it can be expected that homelessness, poverty, and starvation will be nearly eliminated.
        <br>
        It will also increase the amount of nature and farmland, because urban sprawl will be significantly reduced.
        <br>
        Government spending is no longer an issue, because every taxpayer is also an equal landowner.
        <br>
        Burdensome taxes can be minimized or eliminated, because of the economic growth caused by putting land to efficient uses.
        <br>
        Workers will automatically gain better working conditions and pay, because companies will have to compete with merely living on the dividend.
        <br>
        In the general case, this tax cannot be passed onto renters, because if the landlord could charge more for rent without causing vacancy, they would.
        <br>
        The only case where it could be passed on is due to the landlord undervaluing their land.
        <br>
        Pricing solutions such as Realpage only provide landlords with better information on their land values, they cannot increase the demand for land.
        <h2>Existing landowners</h2>
        Existing landowners will lose their 'investment' in their land, as land prices everywhere will approach 0.
        <br>
        Land will instead be owned by whomever is willing to pay the largest tax on it.
        <br>
        This loss of value is precisely why land value taxes are difficult to implement.
        <br>
        The loss in value doesn't simply disappear, rather it is invested in the community.
        <br>
        So the wealth which otherwise was locked up by the landowner causes expotential growth in the wealth of society.
        <br>
        Even the existing landowners would be better off in this system, yet they (understandably) only focus on the immediate loss of wealth.
        <br>
        Any kind of compensation to the existing landowners is akin to reimbursing slave owners for their loss.
        <br>
        However, that compensation would eventually be distributed back into the community through the land value tax.
        <br>
        Even if a full LVT is not implemented, even a minor adjustment in the right direction will be beneficial.
        <br>
        For example, the bay area's housing crisis could be largely resolved by repealing proposition 13, adding property tax exemptions for improvements, and obliterating zoning laws.
        <br>
        This would generate massive tax revenue and require less spending on homelessness, allowing for California to lower income taxes, further boosting the economy.
        <br>
        In general, arguments against Georgism come from only looking at the drawbacks of the tax in the extreme cases, while ignoring or misunderstanding the enormous benefits of it.
